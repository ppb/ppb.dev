We, the maintainers of PursuedPyBear, will not be attending PyCon 2022 in Salt Lake City in person.

Quite simply, we do not feel that it is possible to safely hold a conference of that size with COVID-19 numbers as high as they are.

We will instead be individually donating to the Python Software Foundation.
