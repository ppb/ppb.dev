We went for a smaller release, but we got a lot done for it only being
a few months. The most important bits are that all of the input events
are in! Some cool stuff includes sprites scaling automatically and a
new way to move between scenes that uses the event system. That means
the old method is officially deprecated.

New stuff:
* MouseButton events
* Key events
* Add a title to the game window
* Sprite scaling based on game unit size
* Keycodes flags
* New scene change mechanism that uses the event system

Changed stuff:
* Scene defaults are now class attributes
* Most Sprite defaults are now class attributes
* Flags can now be type hinted properly
* Scenes no longer infinitely respawn their child scenes if running is
  True.
* Fixed an issue with the frame being different dimensions to the
  viewport.
* Fixed a bug in the Camera.point_in_viewport function
* Default pixel ratio is now 64:1 (64 pixels to 1 game unit)
* New (better) run function
* Other type hinting fixes

Removed stuff:
* bb attribute removed from sprites
