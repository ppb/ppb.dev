0.6.0b1 is now out! Want to try our new [Animation feature](https://ppb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/features/animation.html)?

Or maybe you'd like our brand new API for subsystems: No more replicating the renderer and
updater just to add your own custom subsystem. And they interact with the engine in an all
new way. Just respond to the new Idle event and handle your timing based systems with
style.

Remember, this is considered a prerelease, so to get it via pip:

    pip install ppb==0.6.0b1
    
Please report any issues you find to the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/issues)!

## Full release notes:

First beta of our Summer Solstice 2019 release.

Note that because of incompatibilities, PyGame 1 and Python 3.6 & 3.7 are the only supported
versions. Neither Python 3.8 nor PyGame 2 are supported in this release. (This will hopefully
be fixed for our Fall Equinox 2019 release, but its largely out of our hands.)
