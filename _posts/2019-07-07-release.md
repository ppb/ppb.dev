Good news, everyone! A release cycle has come to a close, resulting in `ppb` v0.6
and (drumroll please), `ppb-vector` v1.0, a stable release!

_[party horn noises]_

I am not going to get into the full changelogs here, they are both quite long.
You can find them on GitHub ([ppb](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/releases/tag/v0.6.0), [ppb-vector](https://github.com/ppb/ppb-vector/releases/tag/v1.0)). I'm
just going to list some highlights.

## `ppb-vector`

([changelog](https://github.com/ppb/ppb-vector/releases/tag/v1.0))

Between the refactorings, the renamings, the immense amount of testing, a lot has
happend. A *lot*. Far and away the most significant change is that `Vector` is
now immutable. While this makes a lot of things inconvenient, we think it will
improve maintainability for everything in the long term.

Other than that, all of the computations and methods have remained the same.

I would like to call out @nbraud for their immense help with the 
[hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/)-based test suite and improving the
numerical algorithms. This literally would not have happened without their help
and the software is dramatically better for it.

As a stable release, the PursuedPyBear team is commiting to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) going forward. That means that 1.0.1
should contain only fixes, no API improvements, 1.1 will be the first version
with new methods and features, and it will be backwards compatible all the way
to 2.0. So if you want to be paranoid, specify `ppb-vector>=1.0,<2` in your
dependencies.

## `ppb`

([changelog](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/releases/tag/v0.6.0))

The Summer 2019 release! :beach_umbrella: (See our [release schedule](2019-06-25-release-schedule.md)) This comes with our usual smattering of
features, rebuilds, and changes, but I would like to highlight a few things.

First, we now have online docs, hosted by ReadTheDocs! You can find them next to
Binny (that would be the blue binary bear in our logo) or at 
[`https://ppb.readthedocs.io/`](https://ppb.readthedocs.io/).

Second, I would like to highlight a significant breaking change: We flipped the
Y-axis. Postive Y now points up, towards the top of the window. Why? Because
that is what is taught in most mathematics classes.

Third and finally, there are impending releases of Python 3.8 and PyGame 2. Do
not install these if you are using PursuedPyBear v0.6. PPB is not compatible
with PyGame 2, and PyGame 1 is not compatible with Python 3.8. Use Python 3.7
and PyGame 1.9 until an updated version of PPB is released. These requirements
are encoded in our various metadata files, so hopefully your tools will honor
this or warn you if not. And we will get an updated release out as soon as
PyGame 2 is out to fix this problem.
