We are very proud to announce that PursuedPyBear will be at [PyCon US 2021](https://us.pycon.org/2021/), in booth and sprint forms!

## Booth

PPB has a booth! As the conference is virtual, so is the booth. But this will be the best way to chat with us about PPB, gamedev in Python, or anything else.

We're also working on some goodies. You'll have to come visit to find out. ðŸ˜‰

## Sprints

As in previous years, PPB will be hosting sprints!

Unique to PPB, we encourage all kinds of ppb-related activities:

* Core development
* Documentation
* Strange hacking (Moshe's [txpursuedpybear](https://github.com/ppb/txpursuedpybear) and Jupyter notebook integrations came out of sprints)
* Just making games

All of these are valuable to us, so we encourage them.

## One Last Thing

1.0 is coming this June! So these sprints are one last chance to get all the details in order for our big debut.
