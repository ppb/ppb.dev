Keeping this short:

PursuedPyBear 1.0.0 was very late, and the maintainers have been focusing on other projects since then.
As such, no work was done with the remainder of this release cycle!

So no 1.1 this week. Keep an eye on the Southern Solstice for our next release.

Continue to try out ppb 1.0, and give us feedback in the [discord](https://discord.gg/uDbauD5) or via the [issues tab](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear/issues).
