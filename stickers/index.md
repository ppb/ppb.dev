# PyCon Stickers!

Just because we can't see in person doesn't mean we should deprive you of
wonderful stickers.

Just fill in your details below and we will send you an envelope full of black
circle adhesive beauties!

We do apologize, but we can only mail to the US.

<form name="stickers" method="POST" action="/stickers/accepted.html" netlify netlify-honeypot="phone">
    <p style="display:none;">
        <label>Don’t fill this out if you’re a person: <input name="phone" /></label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label>Email: <input type="text" name="email" /></label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label>Address: <textarea name="Address"></textarea></label>
    </p>
    <p>(Do we want reCAPTCHA?)</p>
    <p>
        <button type="submit">Request Stickers</button>
    </p>
</form>

(add some details about what the stickers are, exactly)
